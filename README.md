## Welcome
This is an astronomy outreach project that aims at building a bridge between favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro and universities/research centers via a mutual enriching approach. Science dissemination and education are brought into the favela while people of the favela are invited to co-create scientific content in collaboration with students, researchers and professors. This approach promotes inclusion, values community knowledge and culture, and provides institutional support and protection to these fragile contexts.

The potential of astronomy to inspire and fascinate scientists, artists and people around the world has been demonstrated to have a restorative power, contributing to people’s mental well-being, especially for marginalised social groups that live under extremely stressful conditions. Hence we intend to apply that potential in Rio's favelas.

## Running Actions
This project is being introduced in Ninho das Águias, a social-cultural project from PPG favela complex, one of the city’s oldest and most densely populated slums, its origin directly linked to the slavery heritage of Brazil’s society, located in Copacabana it makes a huge contrast with one of the most rich neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro.

Ninho das Águias was designed by the urban artist Acme, dweller of the community. It promotes extracurricular courses for childreen and teenagers of PPG, such as art and dance classes, also classes of astronomy and english.
